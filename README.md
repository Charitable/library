# Charitable Code Snippet library

This is a library of code snippets designed to help end users and theme or plugin developers. 

## How to use the code snippets

If you are new to PHP or WordPress development, we recommend adding these code snippets using the [Code Snippets plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/code-snippets/). This allows you to add the code directly within your WordPress dashboard.

For those a little more familiar with WordPress development, you can use the snippets to create simple standalone plugins. Read the WordPress documentation about [creating a plugin](https://codex.wordpress.org/Writing_a_Plugin).

Alternatively, you could add the snippets directly to your theme or child theme's `functions.php` file. 

## Contributing a snippet

We welcome and encourage everyone to submit their code snippets. If you would like to submit your snippet, please [fork the repository](https://github.com/Charitable/library/fork) and then [https://github.com/Charitable/library/compare/](create a pull request).
