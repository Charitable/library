 * This example shows how to add set the minimum donation amount.

 * When the minimum is 0 (the default), the minimum must be exceeded. i.e. A $0 is not valid.
 *
 * To allow a donation of $0, the charitable_permit_0_donation can be used:
 * add_filter( 'charitable_permit_0_donation', '__return_true' );
